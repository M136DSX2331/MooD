# 😊🤢 MooD 😢😡

We sometimes don’t know exactly what the other person is feeling. 
That way we decided to make an application to detect someone’s mood 
with the aim of just knowing someone’s feelings, to the point of 
giving advice to the other person if they are in a bad mood.

## 🤖 Machine Learning

* Emotional Speech dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess
* Create dataframe that contain filename and its label
* Load, Augmented and Extract the sound using MFCC
* Training, testing and build the model using Tensorflow
* Save and export model with h5 extension
* Because of limitation upload to Github here is the Model of our Project https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cvYWr2jtcLIHgDAgOS6X7qtwG-Rh0Un4/view?usp=sharing

## ☁️ Cloud Computing

* Build an API with FastAPI then implement an API endpoint that will receive requests and provide responses based on a machine learning model.
* Configure and deploy Machine Learning models with Cloud Run: Prepare and format machine learning models for deployment, Use Cloud Run to deploy models as serverless services accessed via API.
* Testing the model that has been deployed using Cloud Run.
